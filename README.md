# pickr

![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-84.21%25-yellow.svg)

## Overview

pickr is a web application that enables users to create rankings of any set of items through intuitive swipe-based pairwise comparisons. Users can rank anything from personal preferences to team decisions by swiping through comparisons, similar to popular dating app interfaces. The app supports flexible comparison group sizes, real-time ranking visualisation, and shareable results through Paco encoding.

**Perfect for:**
- Personal decision making (favourite movies, restaurants, travel destinations)
- Team collaboration (feature prioritisation, candidate ranking, design selection)
- Entertainment & social activities (tier lists, polls, competitions)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pickr
cd pickr
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Primary Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm test             # Run tests in watch mode
npm run coverage     # Generate test coverage report
npm run lint         # Check code quality
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run type-check   # TypeScript type checking
```

### Testing
```bash
npm run test:run     # Run tests once (CI mode)
npm run test:ui      # Open Vitest UI
npm run coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

### Building & Deployment
```bash
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run storybook    # Start Storybook
npm run build-storybook  # Build Storybook
```

### Release & Commits
```bash

npm run release:dry  # Preview release
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file for local development:
```env
# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="pickr"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_PACK_SIZE=50
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_COMPARISON_SIZE=2

# Storage Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_PREFIX="pickr_"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false

# Development Settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_MODE=false
```

### Customisation Options

- **Pack size limits**: Set maximum number of items per pack
- **Storage settings**: Configure local storage behaviour
- **UI themes**: Customise colours and styling in `tailwind.config.ts`

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Core Algorithm Testing
